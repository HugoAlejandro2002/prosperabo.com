# ðŸš€ Getting started app

This document will guide you through the steps required to deploy a Node.js application on a virtual private server (VPS) using Node.js 18+ and PM2. Starting with initialization in a development environment.
PM2 is a process manager that allows you to keep your application always running, even after the server restarts or crashes.

## Install dependencies

Install the dependencies with your package manager of choice:

```bash
yarn
# or
pnpm i ( this project use pnpm )
```

Then, custom scheme.prisma of project, later:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

## Run the development server:

### `develop`

Start your application with autoReload enabled

```
pnpm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This app is running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default.

## Deploy on a VPS:

### Prerequisites

    - Have access to a VPS with a Linux distribution installed (e.g. Ubuntu 22.04).
    - Node.js 18+ LTS installed on the server and port configurated.
    - Basic knowledge of command line and SSH
    - Access to your domain's DNS settings.
    - A domain name pointing to your VPS IP address.
    - A database installed on your VPS or 3rd party (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL).

### ðŸ“š Steps to deploy on a VPS

1.  **Connect to your VPS:**
    Use SSH to connect to your VPS. Replace `your_username` and `your_vps_ip` with your actual username and VPS IP address. e.g: `ssh your_username@your_vps_ip`
2.  **Update your system:**
    Run the following commands to update your system and install necessary dependencies:

    - `sudo apt update`
    - `sudo apt upgrade`
    - `sudo apt install curl`
    - `sudo apt install git`

3.  **Verifing Node.js version:**
    Run the following command to verify the Node.js version installed on your server:
    `node -v`.ðŸ’¡ If Node.js is not installed or the version is lower than 18, then install Node.js 18+.
4.  **Install PM2:**

    - Run the following command to install PM2 globally on your server:

      ```
      npm install pm2@latest -g
      ```

    - ðŸ’¡ If you have a previous version of PM2 installed, you can update it using the command: `pm2 update`

5.  **Clone your repository:**
    Run the following command to clone your repository to your VPS: e.g.:

    - `git clone your_repository_ssh_url`

    Note: Replace `your_repository_ssh_url` with your actual repository URL using ðŸ”— SSH, for ðŸ”’ security. For configuring SSH keys, you can follow the GitHub documentation: [Connecting to GitHub with SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)

6.  **Install dependencies:**
    Navigate to your project directory and install the dependencies using the following commands: e.g: `cd your_project_directory` (On the current production server the directory is: `/htdocs/prosperabo.com`)

    - exe: `yarn` or `pnpm install`

7.  **Configure your environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in your project directory and add your environment variables. You can use the `.env.example` file as a reference.
    ðŸ’¡ Remember to replace the placeholders with your actual values.
8.  **Build your project:**
    Run the following command to build your project:
    ```
     npx prisma generate
     pnpm run build
    ```
    It's recommended to build your project before starting it with PM2.
    ðŸ’¡ If you encounter any errors during the build process, make sure to fix them before proceeding.
9.  **Start your project with PM2:**
    Run the following command to start your project with PM2:
    ```
       pm2 start npm --name "your-app-name" -- start --port <your-port>
    ```
    ðŸ’¡ Replace `<your-port>` with the desired port number for your application.
10. **Verifing your project with pm2:**
    Run the following command to verify that your project is running with PM2:
    ```
      pm2 status
      pm2 list
      pm2 monit
      pm2 logs
    ```
    ðŸ’¡ If you see your project in the list, it means it's running successfully.

## Maintenance & Monitoring with PM2:

    Run the following command to monitor your project with PM2:

| ACTION                  | COMMAND            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ |
| To view your app's logs | pm2 logs my-app    |
| To stop your app:       | pm2 stop my-app    |
| To restart your app:    | pm2 restart my-app |
